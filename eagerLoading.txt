What is laravel eager loading?
Laravel eager loading is a technique used to optimize database queries by loading related models along with the
main model in a single query, instead of loading them separately. This helps to prevent the "N+1 query problem,"
where multiple database queries are executed to fetch related models, which can significantly degrade performance.

Eg. 
1.Basic Eager Loading:
$posts = Post::with('comments')->get();

2.Eager Loading Nested Relationships:
$posts = Post::with('comments.author')->get();

3.Constraining Eager Loading:
$posts = Post::with(['comments' => function($query) {
    $query->where('approved', true);
}])->get();

4.Eager Loading Multiple Relationships:
$posts = Post::with('comments', 'tags', 'author')->get();


Using eager loading can significantly improve the performance of your Laravel application, especially when dealing 
with large datasets and complex relationships.
